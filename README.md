## Features

In this Rust course repository you will find all the code that was written during lectures as well as the exercises that should be done by you.
Code from lectures is located in `lecture_name/src/main.rs`;
Code for exercises that should be done by you is located in `lecture_name/examples/exercise_name.rs`;

## Running locally

You can run all of the code from lectures like this:

- Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Web3-Academy-Rust-Course/rust-course-part-one.git
```

- Navigate to the lecture directory

```shell
cd rust-course-part-one/lecture_name
```

- Run lecture code

```shell
cargo run
```

## Running exercises and working on them

Exercises are set in examples directory of ever lesson and they are compiled on will, thus you won't get compiler error every time you run cargo.
To work on specific exercise and run it:

- Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Web3-Academy-Rust-Course/rust-course-part-one.git
```

- Navigate to the lecture directory

```shell
cd rust-course-part-one/lecture_name
```

- Run specific exercise

```shell
cargo run --example exercise_name
```

If you have done exercise well it will compile and run with no errors, if not the compiler will provide you with helpful compiler error messages and you can fix the code and re-run it again, try to do every exercise properly without cutting corners, and if you are stuck on some part you can check solutions on the separate branch in this repo.
